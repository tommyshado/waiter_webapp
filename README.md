# Waiters web app

Hello everyone, welcome to the Waiters web app. I built this app for waiters to schedule a minimum of three days and a maximum of five to work within a week. I also built this app for an admin to view the scheduled days by the waiters and also clear the schedule for a new week.

## Admin
<span>username<span>: tom <br>
<span>password<span>: 123

## Waiter
Log in as an existing waiter <br>
<span>username<span>: mthunzi <br>
<span>password<span>: 12345

OR sign up a waiter using a signup page
